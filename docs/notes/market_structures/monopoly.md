# Abuse of market power #
A monopoly firm can use its market power to abuse various parties

## Consumers ##
Raise prices above market equilibrium, since consumers have no alternative. 
They can also reduce output to create scarcity and raise the price of their product.

## Rival firms ##
Lower prices below market equilibrium and make losses until the other firm is forced to leave the market

## Suppliers ##
Refuse to buy raw materials unless they drop their prices - since suppliers depend on the firm for profit.

# Natural Monopoly #
In some cases, competition decreases efficiency, for example:
- Railways
- Water provision
- Electricity - National grid

## Characteristics ##
- Extremely high capital cost to set up
- Duplication is unnecessary and wasteful
- Competition does not benefit the consumer

Costs fall in the LR due to **Economies of Scale**, but do not increase due to Diseconomies of Scale.

The Law of Diminishing returns does not apply to Natural Monopolies because there is so much Capital, that you can keep adding variable factors to it.
