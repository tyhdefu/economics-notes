# Abuse of market power #
A monopoly firm can use its market power to abuse various parties

## Consumers ##
Raise prices above market equilibrium, since consumers have no alternative. 
They can also reduce output to create scarcity and raise the price of their product.

## Rival firms ##
Lower prices below market equilibrium and make losses until the other firm is forced to leave the market

## Suppliers ##
Refuse to buy raw materials unless they drop their prices - since suppliers depend on the firm for profit.
