# Characteristics #
- High barriers to entry
- A few firms dominate / high concentration ration
- Profit maximisation
- Interdependence between firms
- Non-price competition
- Strong branding exists
- Collusion likely

# Examples #
- Mobile phone networks
- Supermarkets
- Car manufacturers
- High street banks
- Film studios

# Non-price competition #
In an oligopoly, firms will engage in non-price competition,
since if they lower prices, they are likely to enter a price war.

Examples:
- Marketing / Branding
- Loyalty schemes
- Promotions
- Quality
- Convenience

# Collusion #
Collusion is where firms cooperate in their pricing and output policies.
Firms are incentivised to collude because it allows them to eliminate risk, and gain the best outcome. (Prisoner's Dilemma)

## Tacit Collusion ##
- Legal
- Firms follow a market leader / copy a large rival
- No communication occurs between the firms
Examples: Aldi price matching, Apple Airpods -> Galaxy pods.

# Evaluation of the oligopoly model #
- There are many examples of price competition - e.g Aldi
- Examples of new entrants to oligopolies - e.g Telsa, Disney+ (Large backing firm)
- Does not explain how firms arrive at the original price
- Does not account for the fact firms can test price changes to see if other prices react
