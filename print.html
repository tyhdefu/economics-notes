<p>Supply is the quantity of a good or service that a producer is willing and able to supply onto the market at a given price in a given time period.<br />
The basic law of supply is that as the price of a product increases, businesses expand supply to the market.</p>

<p>The price mechanism is the means by which decisions of consumers and businesses interact to determine the <em><strong>allocation of resources</strong></em>.<br />
It does <strong>not</strong> necessary lead to a equitable distribution of resources, and can lead to market failure.</p>

<p>A taxi firm raises fares at its busiest times by as much as 5x the normal fare. Taxi drivers and customers are notified of the changes by mobile phone. What will result from this policy?</p>
<ul>
<li>A - It will be less likely that there is a market equilibrium</li>
<li>B - Potential customers will have less perfect information?</li>
<li>C - The market surplus will become a shortage</li>
<li>D - The supply of taxi rides will become more price elastic.</li>
</ul>
<p>D - Taxi drivers are more willing to supply rides during higher price times, so the supply will increase in response to price.</p>

<p>The difference between what consumers are <strong>willing to pay</strong>, and the actual <strong>market price</strong></p>
<p><img src="micro/diagrams/consumer_surplus.svg#mono-black" alt="Consumer Surplus Diagram" /></p>
<p>Here, there is a consumer that is willing to pay £4, while the market price is £1. This means they have a consumer surplus of £3 - The good is worth £3 more to them than what they paid for it.
The area shown is all consumer surplus.</p>

<p><img src="micro/diagrams/producer_surplus.svg#mono-black" alt="Producer Surplus Diagram" /></p>
<p>Here, the supplier would be willing to sell at 20p for a given output level, so they have a surplus of 80p when selling at the actual price of £1.
The area shown is all producer surplus</p>

<li>Concentrating resources on a product or task</li>
<li>Happens within businesses</li>
<li>Can happen within a country, such as Bangladesh for textiles</li>
<li>For specialised countries, they export the good they produce</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="advantages"><a class="header" href="#advantages">Advantages</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Increased output. They can focus on being good at making a few goods / services. It is easier to focus on a single product and purchase the components required than to manufacture the components yourself. Fewer areas of expertise are required</li>
<li>Cheaper products / costs of production. Focusing on one good allows you to produce it at scale, which means you can reduce production costs. You can do this by buying special machines that are more efficient that would not have been worth the investment before.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="disadvantages"><a class="header" href="#disadvantages">Disadvantages</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Less demand. Producing a smaller range of products means there are less customers want one of your goods so you may struggle to sell as many products as you could produce.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Vulnerability. You are vulnerable to changes in wants of consumers. You are also more vulnerable to any laws that may be made, such as if you are producing tobacco. It may also make economies / businesses that depend on you vulnerable. If you go out of business there could be a lack of supply in a good, though this only applies for large businesses.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="division-of-labour"><a class="header" href="#division-of-labour">Division of Labour</a></h1>
<p>Division of labour occurs when the production process of a good is broken down into various small tasks.</p>
<h1 id="advantages-1"><a class="header" href="#advantages-1">Advantages</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Increased output - Because of the repetition, a worker improve at a greater speed at a particular task. This means workers can produce more goods in the same amount of time.
<ul>
<li>The worker has to move around less, so they can spend more time doing the same job instead of walking around or switching tools.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Less waste - Workers doing the same task repeatedly are less likely to forget something or make a mistake - Their job is simpler. Additionally, they will become more experienced so they will make less mistakes</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="disadvantages-1"><a class="header" href="#disadvantages-1">Disadvantages</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Boredom. Workers get bored doing the same task over and over. In Henry Ford's case, this meant he had to pay workers more to compensate.</li>
<li>Workers could not produce the product alone. This means it would be difficult for them to get another job, as they are unlikely to find another job in an area they are familiar with. If they created the whole good, they would be able to produce that good or component of it elsewhere.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="elasticities"><a class="header" href="#elasticities">Elasticities</a></h1>
<p>Measures of elasticity measure how responsive one thing is to a change in another.
For example, PED, which measures how Demand varies with price.</p>
<h2 id="elastic"><a class="header" href="#elastic">Elastic</a></h2>
<p>If an elasticity is elastic, it has a magnitude of greater than 1. For example,
1.5, 2, 3, -3, -6, etc.</p>
<p>This means that it is very responsive to the change.</p>
<p>For example, for PED, a PED value of -2 would mean that consumers are very sensitive to a change in price.</p>
<h2 id="inelastic"><a class="header" href="#inelastic">Inelastic</a></h2>
<p>If an elasticity is inelastic, it has a magnitude of less than 1. For example,
0.2, 0.4, -0.3 etc.</p>
<p>This means that it is not very responsive to the change.</p>
<p>For example, for PED, a PED value of -0.2 would mean that consumers are not sensitive to a change in price.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="price-elasticity-of-demand"><a class="header" href="#price-elasticity-of-demand">Price Elasticity of Demand</a></h1>
<p>Price elasticity of Demand measures how responsive <strong>Demand</strong> when <strong>price</strong> is varied.</p>
<p>\( PED = \frac{\%\Delta QD}{\%\Delta P} \)</p>
<p>PED is almost always negative, since for most goods, price and demand are inversely proportional. (If something costs more, then you buy less.).</p>
<p>Sometimes we drop the minus sign, since its usually obvious anyway.</p>

<h1 id="perfectly-inelastic-demand"><a class="header" href="#perfectly-inelastic-demand">Perfectly Inelastic Demand</a></h1>
<p>The more <strong>i</strong>nelastic a good is, the more it looks like an '<strong>I</strong>' / the more vertical it is.
Perfectly inelastic demand means that consumers will always a fixed quantity, regardless of price / supply.</p>
<p><img src="micro/elasticities/diagrams/perfectly_inelastic_demand.svg#mono-black" alt="Perfectly inelastic demand - Vertical line" /></p>
<h1 id="perfectly-elastic-demand"><a class="header" href="#perfectly-elastic-demand">Perfectly Elastic Demand</a></h1>
<p>The more elastic a good is, the more flat it is. Elastic goods are very responsive to changes in price.
Perfectly elastic means below the demand curve everything is purchased immediately, and above nothing will be purchased.
An example of a perfectly elastic demand curve is commodities / wheat (before regulations). The demand is perfectly elastic, at the market price. Anything above the market price won't be purchased because there are so many other sellers selling at market price.</p>

<p>Income elasticity of demand measures how responsive <strong>Demand</strong> is when <strong>income</strong> is varied.</p>
<p>\(\text{YED}  =\frac{\%\Delta QD}{\%\Delta Y}\)</p>
<p>Y stands for income.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;---- -2 ---- -1 ----- 0 ----- 1 ----- 2 ------&gt;
       Inferior        |     Normal    | Luxury
</code></pre>
<h1 id="inferior-goods"><a class="header" href="#inferior-goods">Inferior Goods</a></h1>
<p>Inferior goods have a YED of less than 0. This means that when people's
incomes increase, they buy less of the good.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Own-brand goods</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="normal-goods"><a class="header" href="#normal-goods">Normal Goods</a></h1>
<p>Normal goods are ones that increase slightly when people incomes increase.
They will buy more, but not necessarily a lot more.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Branded goods</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="luxury-goods"><a class="header" href="#luxury-goods">Luxury Goods</a></h1>
<p>Normal goods are ones that increase significantly when people's incomes increase.
They will buy a lot more. They will increase % the amount they buy by more than
double their increase in income.</p>
<p>This makes sense for things like holidays, as if someone gets a 10% income rise,
all of that income is not being used, so they will have a lot more to spend on
luxuries. Also bear in mind that this would be a 20% increase in luxury goods
(assuming they have YED of 2), which won't be all of their spending, so it will
not be 20% of what they are spending.</p>

<p>\(\text{PES}  =\frac{\%\Delta QS}{\%\Delta P}\)</p>
<ul>
<li>Always positive</li>

<h1 id="factors-that-impact-pes"><a class="header" href="#factors-that-impact-pes">Factors that impact PES</a></h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capacity utilisation</strong> - How close to full capacity is a firm/market operating.<br />
If there is lots of spare capacity, then supply will be elastic.</li>
<li><strong>Availability of stock</strong> - If there is a lot of spare stock then supply will be<br />
elastic and vice versa.</li>
<li><strong>Availability of raw materials</strong> - If raw materials are in short supply, this is<br />
likely to cause supply to be inelastic.</li>
<li><strong>Time</strong> - Over time, supply will be more elastic since firms are able to respond<br />
to higher prices by investing in more capital</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="perfectly-inelastic-supply"><a class="header" href="#perfectly-inelastic-supply">Perfectly Inelastic Supply</a></h1>
<p>Perfectly inelastic supply means that a fixed amount will be supplied regardless of the price level.
An example could be the supply of the crown jewels - their price can vary but the quantity supplied won't change, there is always a fixed quantity of 1.
Another example is carbon credits - there are a fixed amount given by the government and then firms have to compete for a fixed supply.</p>

<h1 id="perfectly-elastic-supply"><a class="header" href="#perfectly-elastic-supply">Perfectly Elastic Supply</a></h1>
<p>Perfectly elastic supply means that supply will supply an infinite amount of good above/at a certain price level, but nothing below it.
An example of perfectly elastic supply is imports - The world supply of a good has a fixed price, and changes in demand in a particular are insignificant compared to the world supply.</p>

<p><strong>MSC &gt; MPC</strong></p>
<p>In this example, pollution is used as an example of a negative production externality.
Pollution has a negative effect when it is produced, therefore it is a negative <em>production</em> externality.
The social cost of producing pollution is higher than the private cost (MSC &gt; MPC), therefore firms overproduce, producing the amount that is good for them, and not at the level which is good for society. The MSC curve is to the left of the MPC curve since that is like the supply curve, but is more costly than the MPC curve, therefore it is to the left.</p>
<p>When there is a negative production externality, we want to reduce production in order to maximise social welfare. (This makes sense, as less pollution is good). However no pollution would not be truly best for society because this would mean having to shut down lots of power stations, and leave many without power, and then likely there would be shortages of water and food.</p>

<p><strong>MSB &lt; MPB</strong></p>
<p>In this example, smoking is used as an example of a negative consumption externality.
Smoking has a negative effect when consumed. This is because they lead to health problems which will then have to be paid for by the country's healthcare system, and may lead to workers having more sick days and working less.
The social benefit of smoking is less than the private benefit of smoking. Therefore people consume more cigarettes than they should.
The MSB curve is like a demand curve. If consumers consumed based on the MSB then they would consume less, i.e a shift to the left of the MPB.</p>
<p>When there is a negative consumption externality, we want to decrease consumption in order to maximise social welfare. However no smoking may be worse overall for the society as no money / business is gained from the sale of cigarettes (and the taxes come with it).</p>
<p>The filled in area represents the welfare loss because of market failure.</p>

<p><strong>MSC &lt; MPC</strong></p>
<p>In this example, training in transferable skills is used as an example of a positive production externality.
Training in transferable skills is done by individual firms, but increases the skill of the worker. This means that there is a gain for all firms in future who hire the same worker. If all firms are training their staff, then all firms will gain from other firms' training of workers.
The private cost of training is more than social cost (MPC &gt; MSC), this means that firms do not train workers as much as they should, because it costs them more than it costs society. The MSC curve is to the right of the MPC curve because they are like supply curves, where the costs of production are lower for society compared to the private cost, so MSC is to the right of MPC.</p>
<p>When there is a positive production externality, we want to increase production of the good in order to maximise societal welfare.</p>

<p><strong>MPB &lt; MSB</strong></p>
<p>In this example, education is used as an example of a positive consumption externality.
Education has a positive effect when consumed, since all firms that later hire that worker will have a more skilled worker that is more productive and efficient. The MPB of education is lower than the MSB since more education results in higher expected wages, but does not account for the increased productivity gained by the firms that you work for. This is why MSB is higher than MPB. MSB is like a demand curve, and we want consumers to demand education more, as it provides a greater benefit than they receive.</p>
<p>When there is a positive consumption externality, we want to increase demand to maximise social welfare.</p>

<p>Profit plays an important role in the market economy.</p>
<ul>
<li>Profit is the reward to shareholders and owners of a business</li>
<li>Profit creates incentives for enterprise / innovation</li>
<li>Profit attracts more firms to an industry, increasing competition
<ul>
<li>This decreases prices in the LR, as firms compete on price</li>
<li>This leads to increased choice as there are more products from different firms to chose from</li>
<li>Super-normal profit is competed away in the LR</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Profit in the LR allows for Research &amp; Development
<ul>
<li>This leads to dynamic efficiency</li>
<li>This leads to lower prices and higher quality products in the LR</li>
<li>Increased productivity -&gt; economic growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lack of profit in a industry will cause firms to leave the industry
<ul>
<li>This means profit helps signal where more or less supply is needed in an industry, helping to achieve allocative efficiency</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Higher profit enables wages to rise</li>
<li>Profit can be taxed via corporate tax to allow the government to gain revenue</li>
<li>Profit can allow firms to build up a buffer against an economic downturn</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="profit-evaluation"><a class="header" href="#profit-evaluation">Profit Evaluation</a></h2>

<li>Profit can cause firms to take too many risks, i.e 2008</li>
<li>Profit can lead to inequality especially if firms have monopoly/monopsony power

<h1 id="non-price-competition"><a class="header" href="#non-price-competition">Non-price competition</a></h1>
<p>In an oligopoly, firms will engage in non-price competition,

<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing / Branding</li>
<li>Loyalty schemes</li>
<li>Promotions</li>

<li>Convenience</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="kinked-demand-curve"><a class="header" href="#kinked-demand-curve">Kinked Demand Curve</a></h2>
<p>The kinked demand curve demonstrates why there is non-price competition.
Since there is <strong>interdependence</strong>, the other firms in the oligopoly will react rapdly to price changes.</p>
<p>If one firm drops their prices, the rest will follow, which leads to demand not increasing by much (Moving in the inelastic region).<br />
If one firm raises their prices, the rest will keep their prices the same, and consumers will switch to other firms, causing a big drop in demand (moving in the elastic region).<br />
This means that the most logical thing to do is keep the price the same.</p>

<h1 id="discontinuous-mr"><a class="header" href="#discontinuous-mr">Discontinuous MR</a></h1>
<p>In oligopoly, there is a gap in MR between the two MC curves. This is because between these two cost curves, firms <strong>will not change their price</strong>.
This is because if they raise prices, they will lose more customers and profit in comparison to keeping prices the same.<br />
Alternatively, lowering prices would likely result in a price war, which would also mean lower profits.</p>
<h1 id="collusion"><a class="header" href="#collusion">Collusion</a></h1>
<p>Collusion is where firms cooperate in their pricing and output policies.

<p>Peak travellers are travelling as a <strong>necessity</strong>, so their demand is <strong>inelastic</strong>, so they can raise prices without losing many customers.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="contestable-markets"><a class="header" href="#contestable-markets">Contestable Markets</a></h1>
<p>The Contestable Market model suggests that even if there are high costs to entering the market, this does not matter unless these cannot be recovered upon exiting the market.</p>
<p>The contestable markets model proposes that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of firms is not the most important factor, instead it is the absence of barriers to entry and <strong>sunk costs</strong></li>
<li>Contestable markets are assumed to have free entry to new firms and free exit for incumbents and new entrants</li>
<li>Free entry assumes that all firms and new entrants have access to the same technology</li>
<li>New firms are not prohibited from entry by incumbents exploiting unachievable economies of scale (This means a natural monopoly is not contestable)</li>
</ul>
<p>Entry to a market is usually costly to the entering firm, but the firm can still be contestable if these costs can be recovered when exiting the market.</p>
<h1 id="sunk-costs"><a class="header" href="#sunk-costs">Sunk Costs</a></h1>
<p>Sunk costs are the costs that you pay to enter the market, but cannot recover when exiting the market.</p>
<p><strong>Capital</strong> is the biggest sunk cost.
This is because of the value of capital depreciates over time, meaning that you cannot recover the same amount of money that you paid for the capital when selling it.</p>
<p>However this can be avoided by <strong>renting</strong> the capital instead of purchasing it. This means that you do not have to pay the cost of the depreciation.</p>
<p>For example, in the Airline market, if you purchase a new plane, it will lose value rapidly first, and you will not be able to sell it for as much as you paid for it.
However, if you rent the plane, you do not have to resell, and the cost of rent will be a part of your costs of production, and factored into your price.</p>
<p>So, by renting, markets become more contestable.</p>
<h1 id="hit-and-run"><a class="header" href="#hit-and-run">Hit and Run</a></h1>
<p>A contestable market allows <strong>hit and run</strong>, allowing new firms to enter, compete away SNP then leave the market. Barriers to exit prevent hit and run.</p>
<p>If the industry becomes contestable, then the incumbent(s) <strong>fearing new firms</strong> will reduce their prices.
This means that firms don't even have to enter the market to eliminate SNP, unlike in the other models.</p>
<p>Incumbents also strive to be productively efficient in order to deter new entrants - the lower they costs are, the harder it is to compete with them.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="monopsony"><a class="header" href="#monopsony">Monopsony</a></h1>
<p>A Monopsony is a labour market dominated by a <strong>single buyer of labour</strong>.
This prevents a perfect labour market because a single firm has influence over the labour market.</p>
<p><strong>ACL</strong> - Average cost of Labour = \(\frac{\text{Total wage costs}}{\text{Number of workers employed}}\)<br />
<strong>MCL</strong> - Marginal cost of labour - Addition to cost from employing 1 more worker</p>
<h1 id="nhs-example"><a class="header" href="#nhs-example">NHS Example</a></h1>
<p>The NHS is a Monopsony employer for Nurses.
MCL for a Monospony is very high/steep because every time you attract new workers with a higher wage rate, the firm must increase the wages of <strong>all existing workers</strong> to match.</p>
<p><img src="micro/labour_market/diagrams/monopsony.svg#mono-black" alt="Monopsony diagram" /></p>
<p>In a competitive labour market the wage would be Wc and the quantity employed Qc.
This would mean no profit as AC=AR.
However, the monopsony uses the fact that it is the main employer to maximise profit (MC=MR) to limit employment to X and although there should be a higher wage, the monopsony pushed wages down to Wm since the workers don't have a choice but to accept the wage (they cannot lose workers, since there are no other firms able to hire them).</p>
<h1 id="solution-to-monopsony"><a class="header" href="#solution-to-monopsony">Solution to Monopsony</a></h1>
<p>A monopsony can be <strong>partially</strong> solved by a trade union.</p>
<p><img src="micro/labour_market/diagrams/monopsony_trade_union.svg#mono-black" alt="Monopsony solution diagram" /></p>
<p>Collective bargaining allows the trade union to get a higher wage for its workers, moving the wage close to the competitive wage.</p>

<p>A group of workers who join together to maintain and improve their conditions of employment including their pay.</p>
<p><strong>Collective Bargaining</strong> - A process where wages and other conditions of employment are negotiated and agreed upon by a union(s) with an employer(s)</p>
<p><img src="micro/labour_market/diagrams/trade_union.svg#mono-black" alt="Trade Union Diagram" /></p>
<p>A trade union bargains for a higher wage for all of its workers, creating a price floor on labour at WT.
However - this can cause unemployment as firms have to reduce costs after their costs raise - they do this by firing some workers, so Q -&gt; Q1. This unemployment may be mitigated by increasing labour productivity, such as workers agreeing to work harder. Sometimes workers will work harder due to their higher pay.</p>
<p>A trade union also creates a disequilibrium as there is excess supply of workers: more workers are willing to work at
the wage WT than the firm demands.</p>

<p>Offering a limited number of options so that they are not overwhelmed by the complexity of the situation.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="bounded-rationality"><a class="header" href="#bounded-rationality">Bounded Rationality</a></h1>
<p>Bounded rationality is the theory that there is only so much information we can consider when making decisions.
These decisions are rational given the limited choice and awareness of the situation, but often don't maximise total utility, because people don't want to spend ages considering every option.</p>
<p>It could be argued that this is rational behaviour, as some things aren't worth spending the time thinking about. For example, It may be more rational to eat the same cereal every day rather than spend 5 minutes considering what activites you are likely to do, and what nutrients would be most optimal for your day.</p>
<p>The increase in technology has made information more widely available than ever, giving a greater amount of information, but this means that its almost impossible to read all of the information and weigh everything up against eachother in a reasonable time. It could be argued that the availability of information leads to more use of rules of thumb.</p>
<h2 id="rules-of-thumb"><a class="header" href="#rules-of-thumb">Rules of Thumb</a></h2>
<p>The theory of bounded rationality suggests that people make decisions on basic rules of thumb.
This means that they use their previous experience to make a best-guess on the actual best option.
For example, some people may use the rule of thumb that more expensive goods will be higher quality, when this isn't necessarily the case.</p>
<h2 id="consequences-of-bounded-rationality"><a class="header" href="#consequences-of-bounded-rationality">Consequences of Bounded Rationality</a></h2>
<p>Given that agents with bounded rationality don't fully consider all the options and information, it means that we can use Choice Architecture to influence people's decisions. This includes nudges.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="irrational-behaviour"><a class="header" href="#irrational-behaviour">Irrational behaviour</a></h1>
<p>In economics we often assume that individuals are rational, but this is not always the case. Irrational agents make decisions that don't maximise utility.</p>
<p>Irrationality can lead to market failure, loss of welfare or individual consequences like addiction.</p>

<li>Many businesses benefit directly, such as building supply industries, archetects.</li>
<li>Constructing new homes means wages and profits flow in the circular flow of income</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Will the extra incomes stay inside the circular flow of income?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If yes, the multiplier effect is likely to be strong and resultant impact on GDP quite large</li>
</ul>
<p>If the value of the multiplier is 1.5, then the final impact is £300m
If the value of the multiplier is 1.25, then the final impact is £250m</p>
<h2 id="multiplier-effect-example"><a class="header" href="#multiplier-effect-example">Multiplier effect example</a></h2>
<p>Assume that for each £100 of extra income</p>

<li>20% (0.2) is taken in taxation (T)</li>
<li>20% (0.2) leaks from the economy due to imports (M)</li>

<p>\(\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{0.1 + 0.2 + 0.2} = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2\)</p>

<p>In the short-run, firms may have little flexibility when it comes to changing their inputs.
If they need to change output in the short run they may need to increase the amount they use their resources, such as paying workers overtime.</p>

<p>Traditional economies are largely dependent upon subsidence.</p>
<h2 id="transitional-to-take-off"><a class="header" href="#transitional-to-take-off">Transitional to take off</a></h2>
<p>Growing surplus leads to an expansion in investment. 
Higher investment promotes greater growth while rising incomes feed into AD.
There is growth in the secondary sector.</p>
<h2 id="take-off"><a class="header" href="#take-off">Take off</a></h2>
<p>Expanding AD, employment opportunities and growing incomes would lead to the development of 
infrastructure, human and physical capital associated with a mature economy.</p>
<h2 id="high-mass-consumption"><a class="header" href="#high-mass-consumption">High mass consumption</a></h2>
<p>Lots of consumption within an economy which provides sustained demand for the outputs of a developed economy.</p>
<p>The most crucial part of the model is <strong>take off</strong>. The implication is that additional savings/investment could
set off a chain reaction of development. This culminates in sustained economic development.</p>

<p>Supply side policies will increase growth and development.</p>
<p>However, they are very expensive and take a long time, so this may not be viable for LDC.</p>
<h2 id="join-a-trading-bloc"><a class="header" href="#join-a-trading-bloc">Join a trading bloc</a></h2>
<p>Joining a trading bloc could reduce costs of production and increase exports.</p>
<p>However, if a country is very small, infant industries may suffer.
Furthermore, an LDC may have to bend to the will of a larger nation.</p>
<h2 id="reduce-ir"><a class="header" href="#reduce-ir">Reduce IR</a></h2>

<h2 id="borrow-from-the-imf"><a class="header" href="#borrow-from-the-imf">Borrow from the I.M.F</a></h2>
<p>The LDC could borrow from the International Monetary Fund.</p>

and there are normally additional conditions which are not beneficial to the LDC.</p>
<h2 id="fdi-foreign-direct-investment"><a class="header" href="#fdi-foreign-direct-investment">F.D.I (Foreign Direct Investment)</a></h2>
<p>The LDC could get investment from another country.</p>
<p>However this is normally expected to be back in some way, e.g political favours.
It can result in exploitation and kill off infant industries (the investing country
will want their large firms to be able to move into the country).</p>
<h2 id="oda-overseas-development-assistance--foreign-aid"><a class="header" href="#oda-overseas-development-assistance--foreign-aid">O.D.A (Overseas development assistance / Foreign Aid)</a></h2>
<p>Foreign Aid is intended to help stimulate growth and development in the LDC.
It is intended to kick start the &quot;take-off&quot; stage.</p>
<p>It can be argued that developed nations will receive a benefit from the LDC developing,
as they will gain a trading partner.</p>
<p>There are also humanitarian reasons for foreign aid. This can include helping to
alleviate poverty and address income inequality. It can help solve market failure
such as lack of healthcare or education within the LDC.</p>
<p>O.D.A Was designed to help countries achieve development goals.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-reasons-behind-oda"><a class="header" href="#alternative-reasons-behind-oda">Alternative reasons behind O.D.A</a></h3>
<p>Polictical motivation. For example the USA donates foreign aid to Pakistan.
In exchange, they are able to use military facilities in Pakistan.</p>
<p>It can also encourage trade between countries. The UK gave foreign aid to India,
partly due to understanding the importance of India as a trade partner now and in future.</p>
<h3 id="reasons-why-countries-dont-benefit-from-oda"><a class="header" href="#reasons-why-countries-dont-benefit-from-oda">Reasons why countries don't benefit from O.D.A</a></h3>
<p>Some countries are at such a low stage of development (not close to take off), that
they are unable to benefit from foreign aid. They don't have the resources and the
institutions in place to use it effectively.</p>
<p>Bad governance in some countries, such as corruption means the % of aid reaching its
intended purpose is minimal.</p>
<h2 id="barriers-to-development"><a class="header" href="#barriers-to-development">Barriers to development</a></h2>
<p>The following things prevent a country from developing from these measures.</p>

<li>Specific projects are poorly chosen</li>

<ul>
<li>As AD shifts to the right the economy grows and unemployment falls.</li>
<li>LRAS is <strong>elastic</strong> up until the curve. This is because of spare capacity in the economy.</li>
<li>As AD reaches the curve, this then leads to a rise in price level - No spare capacity so firms are having to compete for labour.</li>
<li>The price level rises from this point onwards as the <strong>labour market begins to tighten</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="tightening-of-the-labour-market"><a class="header" href="#tightening-of-the-labour-market">Tightening of the labour market</a></h1>
<ul>
<li>Small pool of labour remaining with skills, so firms increase ways to attract them to work for them.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="philips-curve"><a class="header" href="#philips-curve">Philips Curve</a></h1>
<p>The Philips curve shows the relationship between unemployment and inflation.</p>
<h2 id="sr-philips-curve"><a class="header" href="#sr-philips-curve">SR Philips Curve</a></h2>
<p>In the short run, the Philips curve shows that inflation is inversely proportional to unemployment.
This means that if you try to reduce unemployment, inflation will increase.</p>
<p><img src="macro/diagrams/philips_curve_sr.svg#mono-black" alt="SR Philips Curve" /></p>
<p>As unemployment reduces from 6% -&gt; 2%, inflation rises from 1% -&gt; 6%<br />
This is due to demand pull inflation / tightening of the labour (rising wages).</p>
<h3 id="stagflation"><a class="header" href="#stagflation">Stagflation</a></h3>
<p>Stagflation is where unemployment and inflation is high at the same time.
It can occur when there are supply side shocks. These cause cost push inflation, regardless of unemployment levels.
One example of stagflation is when Trade Unions were extremely strong, causing cost push inflation.</p>
<h2 id="lr-philips-curve"><a class="header" href="#lr-philips-curve">LR Philips Curve</a></h2>
<p>However, in the long run, the philips curve is perfectly inelastic. I.e Unemployment has no effect on inflation in the LR.
This is because the level of unemployment will always return to the Natural Rate of Unemployment in the long run.</p>
<p><img src="macro/diagrams/philips_curve_lr.svg#mono-black" alt="LR Philips Curve" /></p>
<p>In this example, the LRPC curve is shifting left. This could be because benefits and income taxes were reduced (supply side policy).</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="government-bonds"><a class="header" href="#government-bonds">Government Bonds</a></h1>
<p>Government bonds are how the government takes loan. They are also known as gilts.
They sell &quot;bonds&quot; which pay the owner a certain amount every year and when the bond expires, the government pays the fully amount back to the owner.
This makes them very safe investments.</p>
<p><strong>Coupon</strong> - The guaranteed fixed annual interest payment, normally divided into two 6-month payments.</p>
<p>\(\text{Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual coupon payment}}{\text{Current market price}} \times 100\%\)</p>
<p>If the market price of a bond increases, the yield will decrease (since it has the same coupon, but is more expensive)</p>
<p>A higher yield means it is more desirable.</p>

<p>The crowding out view is that a rapid increase in government spending / borrowing may steal scarce productive resources from  the private sector, and end up in the public sector, where there is lower efficiency. This view is a classical view.</p>
<ul>
<li>To cover budget, the government borrows money</li>
<li>To do this it sells bonds to private sector, which raise its revenue.</li>
</ul>
<p>In order to get institutions to buy bonds, it might mean having to raise the interest rate.</p>
<ul>
<li>But raising the interest rate increases saving / reduces investment.</li>
<li>This means more firms will save and lend their money since interest rates are higher</li>
<li>But also, the cost of borrowing increases <strong>for firms</strong>, meaning it is harder for them to invest, so investment reduces</li>
</ul>
<p>AD = C + I + G + (X-M)</p>
<p>Government spending increases, but investment decreases, so no actual growth in AD occurs.</p>

<li>If it is a natural monopoly, such as tap water, it will not be very competitive and the costs are mostly fixed (e.g pipes). A monopoly would likely end up having cheaper prices.</li>
<li>The goal of some industries shouldn't be profit - For example healthcare, the objective is to make people better, not earn as much money as possible.</li>
<li>Regulation may be needed to control the monopoly power if it was not owned by the government - it may be easier / cheaper to just keep a government-owned monopoly.</li>

<p>A current account deficit in simple terms means that Imports &gt; Exports.<br />
This means that there is a large supply of £ since UK companies sell the pound to buy foreign currencies.<br />
This means that the value of the £ will drop, which in turn makes exports more competitive, helping to balance
out the C/A deficit. This is the partial correction.</p>

<p><img src="macro/financial_markets/diagrams/liquity_vs_profitability.svg#mono-black" alt="liquity_vs_profitability.svg" /></p>
<p>Liquidity is important as it protects a bank against bad debt, debt which has been defaulted.<br />
Debt is promised to the bank, so it counts as an asset, but the asset can lose all its value if the borrower defaults.</p>
<p>However, banks want to be profitable, so they can grow, pay their employees more and increase market share.
In order to be profitable, you have to make investments / loans, which are risky. These are harder to convert back to
cash when needed, so the bank becomes less liquid as all their assets are harder to convert to cash.</p>
<p>Banks need to strike a balance between liquidity, so they don't go bankrupt, while being as profitable as possible.</p>

<p>Secured loans are loans where the bank can take an asset if the borrower defaults.

<li>Interest rates were low and investors were looking for something with better returns</li>
<li>House prices had been rising steadily for many years, so mortgages were safe as if the borrower defaulted, you could
still sell the house for a good price and not lose out.</li>
<li>Mortgages were bundled up into securities and sold to investment banks</li>
<li>The investment banks then sold shares in the securities to customers.</li>
<li>The Securities were rated by a credit rating agency - gave investors confidence</li>
<li>Insurance was available against the mortgages going bust (credit default swap) - further decreasing the perceived risk</li>
<li>As far as investors could tell, it was low risk and high reward.</li>
<li>However, due to the sharp increase in demand for mortgages, banks started giving out sub-prime mortgages
<ul>
<li>Sub-prime mortgages were mortgages that the borrower could not afford, and included sharp increases in interest rates
every year. Banks knew that borrowers would default.</li>
<li>Banks did not care that they were sub-prime because they sold them on and were not responsible for them.</li>
</ul>

<li>Credit rating agencies continued to give them AAA ratings because they were paid for by the banks.</li>

<li>Borrowers began to default on their loans.</li>
<li>The influx of houses on the housing market caused the bubble to burst, causing the house price to drop</li>

<h2 id="absolute-advantage"><a class="header" href="#absolute-advantage">Absolute Advantage</a></h2>
<p>Absolute advantage is where one country can produce a good at a lower unit cost compared to another.
This is normally shown by a greater total capacity, since that leads to higher efficiency (EOS).</p>
<p>According to this theory of trade, the UK will not trade with Kenya.</p>
<h2 id="comparative-advantage"><a class="header" href="#comparative-advantage">Comparative Advantage</a></h2>
<p>Comparative advantage is where one country can produce at a lower opportunity cost to another.</p>
<p>According to this theory of trade, the UK will trade with Kenya.<br />
Opportunity cost of producing F.S in the UK is 1 (1:1)
Opportunity cost of producing F.S in Kenya is 2 (2:1)</p>
<p>This means that the UK gives up less cut flowers per financial service, and therefore it makes sense for the UK
to produce financial services and Kenya to produce cut flowers, and then trade.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="infant-industry-argument"><a class="header" href="#infant-industry-argument">Infant Industry Argument</a></h1>
<p>The Infant Industry argument is the argument that some industries can have a comparative advantage but just need time
to grow first, but they need protecting in the meantime.</p>
<p>Certain industries possess a possible comparative advantage but have not yet exploited economies of scale.
Short-term protectionism allows the &quot;infant industry&quot; to develop its comparative advantage at which point the
protection can be relaxed, leaving the industry to trade freely on the international market.</p>
<p>For example, South Korea put a bubble around their Car Industry by putting high tariffs on car imports (In the 1970s).</p>
<p><img src="macro/trade/protectionism/diagrams/infant_industry_bubble.svg#mono-black" alt="Bubble around South Korean car industry" /></p>
<p>This means that domestic consumers purchase South Korean cars instead of imported cars since they are cheaper.
After a while (2010s), South Korean Car manufacturers have grown larger and now have Economies of Scale. South Korea
then removes the bubble of protection around them since they are now able to rival global firms. If there was never a
bubble around them, they would be unlikely to have been able to compete with global competition and gone bust.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="sunset-industry-argument"><a class="header" href="#sunset-industry-argument">Sunset Industry Argument</a></h1>
<p>The Sunset Industry Argument is the argument that you can protect declining industries with protectionism. This usually
occurs in developed countries.</p>
<h2 id="steel-in-the-uk"><a class="header" href="#steel-in-the-uk">Steel in the UK</a></h2>
<p>Steel is going into decline in the UK, but it used to be a large industry. By putting tariffs on imported steel, it
allows steel manufacturers in the UK to keep being competitive. This is good as it prevents structural unemployment,
but it also means that steel becomes more expensive. </p>
<h2 id="alternatives"><a class="header" href="#alternatives">Alternatives</a></h2>
<p>Alternatively, instead of protectionism, you could use Education and Training to retrain workers into an industry
with a skills gap.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tariffs"><a class="header" href="#tariffs">Tariffs</a></h1>
<p>A tariff is a tax placed on imports. It is set per unit. For example the UK government could put a tariff of £5 per
kilogram of beef imported into the UK. If the market price for beef in the UK without trade is £40, this is what
the diagram would look like.</p>
<p><img src="macro/trade/protectionism/diagrams/tariff.svg#mono-black" alt="tariff.svg" /></p>
<p><strong>A</strong> - Represents the conversion of consumer surplus back to producer surplus (for domestic producers)<br />
<strong>B</strong> - Gain in tariff revenue for the government (tariff per unit (£5) * Q2-&gt;Q4)</p>
<p>Shaded Area - Loss in welfare / deadweight loss</p>
<p>Extension in domestic supply after tariff is added is X-&gt;Y</p>
<p>Y-&gt;Z Represents the disequilibrium between domestic supply and demand after a tariff has been added. This means that
the quantity of imports is Q2-&gt;Q4, filling the disequilibrium.</p>

<h2 id="example-question"><a class="header" href="#example-question">Example Question</a></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The UK has seen significant changes in its pattern of trade with the rest of the world in terms of what we write
and with whom. The UK's current account deficit widened from £29.1bn in 2011 to £100.2bn in 2015.
The deficit in 2015 was 5.4%, the largest annual deficit as a percentage of GDP since records began in 1948.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Explain the possible reasons for changes in the pattern of trade between the UK and the rest of the world.</p>
<h3 id="trading-blocs"><a class="header" href="#trading-blocs">Trading blocs</a></h3>
<p>The UK used to trade with developing nations for raw materials and there were not many trade agreements.
However, over time the EU has grown significantly, a trading bloc with no tariffs, allowing free trade within the block.
This meant that the UK increased trade within the EU and decreased trade with southern countries.
This is because consumers choose cheaper products which come from the EU since there are no tariffs, and firms also
trade with the EU because there are no tariffs, which means they can make more profit. Southern countries are not
part of the EU, so they are left out of the free trade agreement.</p>

<h3 id="explain-possible-causes-of-a-falling-budget-deficit"><a class="header" href="#explain-possible-causes-of-a-falling-budget-deficit">Explain possible causes of a falling budget deficit</a></h3>
<p>Position in the economic cycle:
In a boom, the government is likely to reduce government spending as AD no longer needs boosting. Furthermore, spending too much in a boom could lead to crowding out. This is where the government borrows in order to spend -&gt; this drives up the interest rate, which makes the cost of borrowing higher, reducing the incentive for firms to invest. Furthermore in a boom, the government is likely to have more tax revenue as AD is higher.</p>
<p>Decrease in unemployment:
A decrease in unemployment, will mean that more people are working. This will not only mean that AD shifts right -&gt; more spending -&gt; more tax revenue, but also, the government will not need to pay as much in welfare and JSA payments, which could cause a falling budget deficit.</p>
<p>Growth in the economy:
As the economy grows (AD/LRAS diagram), the real gdp is greater, which means that the government has more tax revenue from VAT since there is more consumer spending.</p>
<h3 id="to-what-extent-do-you-agree-that-reducing-the-budget-deficit-is-more-important-to-the-uk-macro-performance-than-the-ca-deficit-on-the-bop"><a class="header" href="#to-what-extent-do-you-agree-that-reducing-the-budget-deficit-is-more-important-to-the-uk-macro-performance-than-the-ca-deficit-on-the-bop">To what extent do you agree that reducing the budget deficit is more important to the UK macro performance than the C/A deficit on the BoP</a></h3>
<p>High budget deficit will mean a increase of the national debt, which not only will increase the opportunity cost of future years, but will mean that future generations pay for current spending. Reducing the budget deficit will decrease the burden on future generations and mean that in future taxes won't have to be raised to pay for the accumulated debt.</p>
<p>A C/A deficit may not be harmful to economy if the economy is growing (AD/AS), as the main impact of a C/A deficit is that net exports is negative, detracting from AD, however if consumer spending and other components are growing, this isn't a large issue, so in this case a budget deficit is more important.</p>
<p>Not reducing the budget deficit could mean that in future the cost of borrowing increases. This is because the more the UK government borrows, the less confidence bond-purchasers have in the UK government. Running a consistently high budget deficit could mean that in an economic shock, or recesssion, the government is not able to borrow when it is most needed. Government borrowing can be said to have an opportunity cost of borrowing in future. Borrowing too much can mean deeper recessions a greater impact on the economy than just reducing government spending initially. This suggests that reducing the budget deficit is more important than reducing the C/A deficit.</p>
<p>Crowding out.</p>
<hr />
<p>C/A deficit could indicate that the UK only has a comparative advantage in very few small sectors. This means that a C/A deficit could indicate an issue with the structure of the UK economy, and that the UK needs to invest in more supply side policies to become more efficient. Once the UK becomes more efficient, its C/A balance should improve which will mean that the government has succeeded at improving the UK economy, which not only benefits the C/A balance, but also will have the result of reducing inflation, and lowering the cost of living and raising the standard of living for the UK due to a more efficient economy. This would make improving the C/A deficit a good indicator of macro-economic performance.</p>
<p>Trying to reduce the budget deficit could lead to government failure, as the government doesn't want to spend as it will be seen as failing its macro-economic objectives, even in a recession where higher government spending is needed. The budget deficit is more likely to follow booms/recessions rather than indicating whether the government is properly managing debt and its finances. This would make a budget deficit a poor indicator of macro-economic performance.</p>
<p>Reducing the C/A deficit will lead to increase in AD, as in order to reduce the C/A deficit, net exports must be increased. An increase in AD would lead to growth and a reduction in unemployment. Additionally, reducing C/A may involve creating trade deals with other countries, which may lead to trade creation, where the UK is able to switch from one more expensive country to a cheaper one, since tarrifs have now been removed. This would mean cheaper imports which could shift the AS curve right, leading to further growth.</p>
<p>Whether the budget deficit is more important as an objective depends upon whether they are used in conjunction with other objectives. Both objectives are subject to failure if relied upon solely. For example, a C/A deficit could be solved by a large devaluation of the exchange rate, but this would be a solution through the &quot;second best&quot; approach, and would not actually improve the competitiveness of performance of the UK economy. Similarly, reducing a budget deficit is only really desirable in a boom / normal economic times, and if governments don't increase spending during a recession this could lead to less growth and worse economic performance. If reducing the budget deficit is only a goal during a boom, then it is likely to be more important than reducing the C/A deficit, as the C/A deficit could simply be an indicator than the UK is a rich country and hence has a large number of luxury imports.</p>

<p>Education and Training can increase the supply of skilled labour in an economy, (keynesian LRAS / AD), which increases the spare capacity in an economy, reducing the costs for firms and hence reducing inflation, increasing employment and increasing growth. Lower costs of production should also lead to</p>
<p>Infrastructure Investment can increase geographic mobility of labour, which will decrease costs for firms, shifting LRAS right (classical LRAS / AD diagram), which will reduce inflation, increase growth reduce unemployment.</p>
<p>Expansionary monetary policy such as decreasing the IR can lead to an increase in AD. If an economy has spare capacity, such as in a recession, then (keynesian LRAS / AD with spare capacity), then this will not cause inflation, increase growth and employment.</p>
<hr />
<p>Supply side policies such as Education &amp; Training cost a large amount of money and this money will have to come from somewhere -&gt; Most likely this is through higher taxes, such as VAT, which are regressive. This means that the distribution of income will worsen when supply side policies are used. Furthermore, many of the most highly paid dodge tax, which means they are not paying for the supply side policies, instead the burden of tax ends up impacting the poorest most, further worsening the distribution of income.</p>
<p>Supply side policies such as education and training cause a large growth in government spending. If these are used correctly, they will be used when there is not much spare capacity in the economy. However, due to the large time lag of these investments, AD will shift right immediately, whereas LRAS will not shift for likely many years. This could lead to temporary demand-pull inflation.</p>
<p>Decreasing IR can lead to a reduction of saving and increase of spending, increasing AD. However, if IR are kept high for too long, this can lead to consumers have very little savings and borrowing large amounts. An economic shock such as a spike in oil prices could cause the BoE to increase IR, which could lead to consumers defaulting on their loans, including their mortgages. This could cause a recession and hence a fall in consumer confidence.</p>
