# Internal Economies of Scale #
Internal economies of scale are experienced when a **firm** becomes larger.
They cause the average cost of production to fall as output increases.

## Purchasing ##
Purchasing economies of scale mean that a firm is able to by in bulk, and therefore the average cost per unit is smaller.

## Technical ##
E.g self-checkouts. Larger firms can invest in more technologies that reduces their costs.

## Managerial ##
Using specialised staff who are better at the job. They are able to divide labour more and have more experience in their positions, since they can do a single job more efficiently than having to do multiple, since there is more of that job to be done in a large firm.

## Risk-bearing ##
They are able to expand into new areas and bear the costs if they fail, so they are more likely to take risks, which may result in bigger profits, while having little actual risk to them.

## Financial ##
Large firms are able to get lower interest rates on loans, since they can borrow bigger amounts and are more reliable than smaller firms.

## Marketing ##
Large firms can divide their marketing budgets across larger outputs, so the average cost of advertising per unit is less than a smaller firm's.

# External Economies of Scale #
External economies of scale occur outside a firm but within an **industry**.

- Transport networks / infrastructure
- Suppliers relocate closer to firms, decreasing costs
- Influx of human capital / skilled workers.

An example of this is silicon valley.

External economies of scale involve changes outside of the business, such as the expansion of the industry which the firm is a part of. They lower unit costs for many/all firms.

# Diseconomies of Scale #
When firms get too big, costs can increase - They are no longer in the efficient section of the graph.

## Control ##
Harder to control standards and how the business is run at a low level. You cannot visit every store of Starbucks by yourself regularly.

## Communication ##
Harder to communicate messages in the firm as there are far more people to communicate the message to.

## Alienation of workers ##
When workers are working in a large corporation they can feel alienated as they as an individual are not important to the business. It can cause a loss of morale and decrease productivity.

## Internal Politics ##
Shareholders may have differing opinions on what should be done vs CEO and managers.

# Judgements #
The extent to which a firm will experience diseconomies of scale depends on how fast the firm grows. A firm growing too fast could mean the firm does not have time to develop systems and processes in order to manage the diseconomies of scale.
