Price elasticity of Demand measures how responsive **Demand** when **price** is varied.

$\text{PED}  =\frac{\%\Delta QD}{\%\Delta P}$

PED is almost always negative, since for most goods, price and demand are inversely proportional. (If something costs more, then you buy less.).

Sometimes we drop the minus sign, since its usually obvious anyway.

# Factors that affect PED #
- Necessity or Luxury
- Percentage of Income
- Width of market - How many substitutes
- Time (over a long time, people will be more able to switch products)

## Examples of Elastic PED goods ##
- Luxury brands / handbags
- Restaurants
- Netflix / Disney+

## Examples of Inelastic PED goods ##
- Houses
- Bread / milk
- Fuel
