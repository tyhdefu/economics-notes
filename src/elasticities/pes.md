Price elasticity of demand measures how the **supply** of a product varies with
its **price**.

$\text{PES}  =\frac{\%\Delta QS}{\%\Delta P}$

- Always positive

Elastic supply is better because the company can be responsive to a market in order
to maximise profit.

# Factors that impact PES #
- **Capacity utilisation** - How close to full capacity is a firm/market operating.  
  If there is lots of spare capacity, then supply will be elastic.
- **Availability of stock** - If there is a lot of spare stock then supply will be  
  elastic and vice versa.
- **Availability of raw materials** - If raw materials are in short supply, this is  
  likely to cause supply to be inelastic.
- **Time** - Over time, supply will be more elastic since firms are able to respond  
  to higher prices by investing in more capital
