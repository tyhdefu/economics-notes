Cross elasticity of demand compares how the **demand** of one product varies with
the **price** of **another product**.

\\(\text{XED}  =\frac{\\%\Delta \text{QD of Product A}}{\\%\Delta \text{P of Product B}}\\)

```
<---- -2 ---- -1 ----- 0 ----- 1 ----- 2 ------>
      Complimentary    |       Substitutes    
```

# Complimentary Goods #
When XED is negative, the two goods are complimentary.

Strong Compliments - Bike + Bike Pump (e.g -2)
Weak Compliments - Steak and rice (e.g -0.2)

# Substitutes #
When XED is positive, the two goods are substitutes (in competition)

Close Rivals - Iphone vs Samsung (e.g 2.5)
Weak Rivals - Apples and oranges (e.g -0.4)
