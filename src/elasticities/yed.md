Income elasticity of demand measures how responsive **Demand** is when **income** is varied.

$\text{YED}  =\frac{\%\Delta QD}{\%\Delta Y}$

Y stands for income.

```
<---- -2 ---- -1 ----- 0 ----- 1 ----- 2 ------>
       Inferior        |     Normal    | Luxury
```

# Inferior Goods #
Inferior goods have a YED of less than 0. This means that when people's
incomes increase, they buy less of the good.

For example:
- Own-brand goods

# Normal Goods #
Normal goods are ones that increase slightly when people incomes increase.
They will buy more, but not necessarily a lot more.

For example:
- Branded goods

# Luxury Goods #
Normal goods are ones that increase significantly when people's incomes increase.
They will buy a lot more. They will increase % the amount they buy by more than
double their increase in income.

This makes sense for things like holidays, as if someone gets a 10% income rise,
all of that income is not being used, so they will have a lot more to spend on
luxuries. Also bear in mind that this would be a 20% increase in luxury goods
(assuming they have YED of 2), which won't be all of their spending, so it will
not be 20% of what they are spending.

- Holidays
- Hotels
