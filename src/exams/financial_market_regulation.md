# Evaluate the view that strict rules and regulations are essential to create a more stable economy #

## Analysis ##
- Details of 2008. How it happened, market failure -> needs regulation to stop
- Systemic Risk - Banks are interconnected because they loan money to eachother. If one fails they could all fail and
  cause a collapse of the financial system.
- Stress Test - Can the banking sector survive for 30 days of shock -> Capital Ratio
- FPC is proactive rather than reactive. This makes the economy more stable as crisis are less likely and less severe.
  Less opportunity cost and less damage to consumer confidence

## Evaluation ##
- Government Failure - Regulatory Capture
  - The FPC gets money from the firms it regulates which means there is a conflict of interest
- Countries with less regulation get boosted AD as banks move to them.
- Free market means more innovation and growth, which means they could recover from economic shocks better
- Other factors have a greater effect on stability, such as government spending, competence of Central Bank.

## Judgement ##
- To be effective, the regulations need to be international
  - Otherwise, banks will move to countries with less regulation
  - Banks are still interdependent across countries
- Trade off / Opportunity cost
  - Little regulation -> higher AD and faster growth, higher risk of financial crash
  - Strict regulations -> low risk of financial crash, lower AD
