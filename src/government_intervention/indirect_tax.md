A payment that is levied on a good / service by the government.

# Positives #
- Generates revenue for the government to spend on solving market failure -> Hypothecation
- Encourages consumption of other products that have less of a negative impact - Such as more sustainable fashion or healthier food
- Financial intervention tends to be more effective than other methods such as advertising, since people change their purchasing decisions based on price signals.
- if set correctly, the tax will solve the market failure and internalise the negative externality (The 1st and second party will pay the externality) and create a socially optimal outcome.

# Negatives #
- If set incorrectly, can be government failure
- Penalises people who don't over consume
- Indirect taxes are regressive. This means low income earners pay more tax, as a % of their income compared to high income earners.
- An indirect tax will be less effective on inelastic products.
- Difficult to place monetary values on MEC, this involves using judgements. If set incorrectly

# Depends upon / Judgments #
- The PED of the product. If the PED is inelastic, then a change in price won't cause much of a change in demand, and so the tax will be ineffective.

# Incidence of tax #

## Elastic ##

![Elastic demand, tax burden falling mostly on the firm](../diagrams/elastic_indirect_tax_burden.svg#mono-black)

When demand is elastic, consumers are *sensitive* to price changes, so the firm pays most of the tax, in order to maximise their profits.

## Inelastic ##

![Inelastic demand, tax burden falling mostly on the consumer](../diagrams/inelastic_indirect_tax_burden.svg#mono-black)

When demand is inelastic, consumers are *insensitive* to price changes, so the firm pushes the tax onto consumer to maximise profit.
