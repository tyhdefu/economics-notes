A payment made to firms from the government in order to decrease the cost of production and increase supply of a good / service.

# Examples #
- Education
- Farming
- Free school meals
- Bike scheme
- NHS
- Public transport
- Electric cars
- Leisure centre

# Positives #
- If set correctly will correct market failure and create a socially optimal outcome. The market will operate efficiently.
- The third party will receive an increased benefit of consumption / production
- Products become more affordable to lower income consumers (progressive). For example, education is fully subsidised by the government
- A price incentive is more effective than other methods such as advertising

# Negatives #
- Subsidies are expensive
- Government failure will occur if the subsidy is set too high or low (because where to set it is based on a value judgement)
- Firms can be inefficient, as they rely on the subsidy and therefore don't seek to lower costs, since the subsidy will give them sufficient profit.
- Not all of the subsidy is passed on to consumers
- The impact of the subsidy will depend upon the elasticity of demand.

# Judgements #
- If PED is inelastic, the reduction in price won't make much difference in demand, and firms won't lower their prices much.

# Diagrams #
With a subsidy, we want to increase quantity since there is a positive externality that is unaccounted for in the price.

## Positive Production ##
![](../diagrams/subsidy_positive_production.svg#mono-black)

In order to correct a positive production market failure, we add a subsidy, adding a new line with the subsidy, which decreases the price and increases quantity.

## Positive Consumption ##

A positive consumption diagram is more complicated, we can move the quantity to the correct level, but the price will not be at the socially optimal level.
