# Balance of Payments #

The Balance of Payments records money flows into and out of the country in a given time period.

## What is it made of ##
Three parts:
- The Current Account - The largest part
  - Trade in goods and services
  - Income
  - Transfers
- The Financial Account
  - F.D.I
  - Hot Money
- The Capital Account
  - Land

## Flows of money between economies #
Credit: The current account is credited when money flows into it from abroad

Debit: The current account is debited when money flows out from the UK to abroad.

Exports -> Credit  
Imports -> Debit

# Current Account #

## Total Trade ##
Records the value of exports and imports of goods and services.

Examples:
- Credit: Exporting weapons to other countries.
- Debit: Importing cars

Total Trade negative -> Deficit  
Total Trade positive -> Surplus

## Investment Income ##
Records the value of flows of income from investments in the form of interest, profit and dividends.

Examples:
- Credit: Marks and Spencers having stores abroad and bringing profit back to the UK.
- Debit: McDonalds having restaurants in the UK and then sending money back to the US.

## Transfers ##
Records the transfers of money made and received by the government and individuals, e.g Remittances and payments to the IMF.

Examples:
- Credit: Individuals sending money back to the UK from abroad.
- Debit: Individuals sending money back to the Philiphines from the UK.

# Problems with a Current Account Deficit #
- A C/A deficit means you have more imports than exports.
- A C/A deficit is not usually considered as important as the other objectives.
- AD = C + I + G + (X-M) so if net exports are falling, AD is shifting left.

This could cause a reduction in growth or recession, which also means higher unemployment.

## Evaluation of C/A deficit ##
- Inflation reduced / falling
- ER will depreciate, which may cause an automatic correction
- Other components of AD may be rising, which may mean overall there is growth.

# Solving a C/A deficit #

## Expenditure Reducing ##
This method involves reducing the number of imports by generally reducing (luxury) consumption.

- Increase IR (contractionary monetary)
- Increase Income tax (contractionary fiscal)

However:
- Decreases economic growth
- Increases unemployment
- The problem with a C/A deficit is reduced AD, but contractionary policy further reduces AD -> Government failure
- Higher IR means borrowing more expensive
  - LICs affected more -> more inequality
- Income taxes will impact LICs more

## Expenditure Switching ##
Switching import consumption to domestic consumption.

- Protectionism / Tariffs
  - May lead to retaliation
  - Distorts the market, second best option
- Supply Side policies
  - Education and training
    - Opportunity cost and time lag
  - Deregulation
    - Risk to health and safety as well as environmental risks
