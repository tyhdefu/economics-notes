# Circular flow of Income #
The circular flow of income is a model that represents how national income flows around an economy.

![Circular flow of income diagram](diagrams/circular_flow_of_income.svg#mono-black)

## Injections ##
Money that flows into the circular flow of income that can cause national income to **grow**.
- Investments
- Government Spending
- Exports

## Withdrawals ##
- Savings
- Tax
- Imports

## Sectors ##
- A 2 sector model is simplified and only includes Households and Firms (the model above).
- A 3 sector model includes the government, showing tax and government spending
- A 4 sector model includes international trade

## National income changes ##
\\(Injections = Investments + Government Spending + Exports\\)  
\\(Withdrawals = Savings + Tax + Imports \\)  

- If injections = withdrawals then the national income stays the same.
- National income will increase if injections > withdrawals
- National income will decrease if injections < withdrawals
