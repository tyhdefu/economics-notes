# Circular flow of Income #
The circular flow of income is a model that represents how national income flows around an economy.

![Circular flow of income diagram](diagrams/circular_flow_of_income.svg#mono-black)

## Injections ##
Money that flows into the circular flow of income that can cause national income to **grow**.
- Investments
- Government Spending
- Exports

## Withdrawals ##
- Savings
- Tax
- Imports

## Sectors ##
- A 2 sector model is simplified and only includes Households and Firms (the model above).
- A 3 sector model includes the government, showing tax and government spending
- A 4 sector model includes international trade

## National income changes ##
\\(Injections = Investments + Government Spending + Exports\\)  
\\(Withdrawals = Savings + Tax + Imports \\)  

- If injections = withdrawals then the national income stays the same.
- National income will increase if injections > withdrawals
- National income will decrease if injections < withdrawals

# Calculating GDP #
GDP Can be calculated in three different ways. These a different lines on the diagram:
- Output Method
    - Measure the total value of goods and services produced by firms
- Income Method
    - Measure the total amount of income received from firms -> households
- Expenditure Method
    - Measure the total amount of expenditure, households -> firms (AD is the formula for this)

All three of these are equal and will give the same answer.

# Multiplier Effect #
The multiplier effect of the final impact of an injection on an economy.

\\(\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{MPW}\\)

**MPW** - Marginal Propensity to Withdraw (leakage) - What proportion of money given to the economy will be leaked.

\\(\text{MPW} = \text{MPS} + \text{MPI} + \text{MPT}\\)

**MPS** - Marginal Propensity to Save - What proportion of the money will you save if given £100
**MPI** - Marginal Propensity of Imports  
**MPT** - Marginal Propensity of Tax

**Propensity** - What proportion of money given to you will go to something.

## The Multiplier Effect Process ##
The government injects £200m in a project to build thousands of affordable new homes
- £200m in extra demand in the economy
- Many businesses benefit directly, such as building supply industries, archetects.
- Constructing new homes means wages and profits flow in the circular flow of income

**Will the extra incomes stay inside the circular flow of income?**
- If yes, the multiplier effect is likely to be strong and resultant impact on GDP quite large

If the value of the multiplier is 1.5, then the final impact is £300m
If the value of the multiplier is 1.25, then the final impact is £250m

## Multiplier effect example ##
Assume that for each £100 of extra income
- 10% (0.1) is saved (S)
- 20% (0.2) is taken in taxation (T)
- 20% (0.2) leaks from the economy due to imports (M)

The money repeatedly circulates the economy until it is completely leaked out.
- £200m injection ->
  - £20m saved
  - £40m taxed
  - £40m imports
- £100m extra GDP ->
  - £10m saved
  - £20m taxed
  - £20m imports
- £50m extra GDP...

\\(\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{0.1 + 0.2 + 0.2} = \frac{1}{0.5} = 2\\)

So the effect of investment of £100m will be
\\(£100\text{m} * 2 = £200\text{m}\\)

## Simple Multiplier ##
The simple multiplier **only considers savings**. The only leakage is saving. Taxes and imports are ignored.

\\(\text{Multiplier} = \frac{1}{1-\text{MPC}} = \frac{1}{\text{MPS}}\\)

## Causes of a high Multiplier ##
- The economy has plenty of spare capacity (i.e a negative output gap) to meet higher AD
- Marginal Propensity to import and tax is low
- High propensity to consume any extra income (i.e low propensity to save)
- New infrastructure projects often have higher multiplier effect
