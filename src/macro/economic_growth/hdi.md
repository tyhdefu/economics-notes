# Human Development Index #
The Human Development Index is a measure of development.

It uses three key criteria:
- Average life expectancy
- Education Index
    - Mean years of school
    - Expected years of school
- Income Index (GNI at PPP)

The HDI is a number between 0 and 1. A higher number is more developed.

## Drawbacks of H.D.I #
- Doesn't show regional differences
- Slow to respond / doesn't update often enough to show short term changes
- GNI does not show welfare, depends how the government spends it, e.g military

## Improvements to the H.D.I ##
These factors if added to the H.D.I it could make it more accurate.
- Distribution of Income (Included in Human Poverty Index)
- Level of environmental degration
- Freedom / Political Freedom
- Happiness
