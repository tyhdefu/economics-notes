# Rostow's Stages of Economic Growth #
Rostow argues that all economies pass through five stages on their road to full economic development.

- Traditional
- Transitional
- Take-off
- Drive to Maturity
- High mass consumption.

# Stages #

## Traditional ##
Traditional economies are largely dependent upon subsidence.

## Transitional to take off ##
Growing surplus leads to an expansion in investment. 
Higher investment promotes greater growth while rising incomes feed into AD.
There is growth in the secondary sector.

## Take off ##
Expanding AD, employment opportunities and growing incomes would lead to the development of 
infrastructure, human and physical capital associated with a mature economy.

## High mass consumption ##
Lots of consumption within an economy which provides sustained demand for the outputs of a developed economy.

The most crucial part of the model is **take off**. The implication is that additional savings/investment could
set off a chain reaction of development. This culminates in sustained economic development.
