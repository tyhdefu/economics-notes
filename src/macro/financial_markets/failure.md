# Financial Market Failure #

## Moral Hazard ##
When a person or organisation takes more risks because they know they are covered by insurance.

For example, Banks in 2008 acted knowing that governments would bail them out if necessary.

## Asymmetric Information ##
When one individual / party has much more information than the other party, and uses that to exploit the other party.

In 2008 Banks sold mortgages that were sub-prime and sold them as "AAA".
In 2008 Banks gave out mortgages with fine-print that would cause the interest rate to jump rapidly every year,
and knew that the buyers would not be able to pay.

## Speculation ##
A risky action in which a person or organisation tries to predict what will happen to the price of an asset
and buys or sells accordingly to make a profit.

- People in 2008 made the assumption that house prices would continue to climb.

## "Too big to fail" ##
When the systemic risk is so large that they would bring other banks down / the whole financial system down. 
The government has to intervene and bail them out or people would lose their houses and savings.
