# Bank Liquidity and Capital #
Banks have a conflict between profitability and liquidity.

Liquidity is important as it protects a bank against bad debt, debt which has been defaulted.  
Debt is promised to the bank, so it counts as an asset, but the asset can lose all its value if the borrower defaults.

However, banks want to be profitable, so they can grow, pay their employees more and increase market share.
In order to be profitable, you have to make investments / loans, which are risky. These are harder to convert back to
cash when needed, so the bank becomes less liquid as all their assets are harder to convert to cash.

Banks need to strike a balance between liquidity, so they don't go bankrupt, while being as profitable as possible.

# Secured vs Unsecured Loans

| Secured                 | Unsecured         |
|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Mortgage - 5%           | Credit card - 22% |
| Car loan / finance - 7% | Overdraft - 20%   |
|                         | Personal Loan     |

Secured loans are loans where the bank can take an asset if the borrower defaults.
These have much lower interest rates because the bank has to take much less risk, and so they don't have to charge higher
interest rates to compensate for borrowers defaulting.

Secured loans are less risky.
