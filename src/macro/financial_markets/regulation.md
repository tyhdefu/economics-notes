# Financial Regulation #
After 2008, the Bank of England was given powers to ensure the stability of the financial markets and prevent
2008 occurring again.

# Interventions #
- "Stress-test" -> Check capital ratios to ensure they could survive 30 days of economic turmoil
- Can ask Commercial Banks and Lenders to increase capital buffer in difficult economic circumstances
- FPC can make recommendations to PRA and FCA
- FPC can recommend changes in regulation
- Ask to look at unregulated markets

# Reasons for Regulatory changes #
- Proactive instead of reactive
- Reduce likelihood of future financial crash
- Monitor activity more closely and have an early warning system
- Can take actions to risks of a crisis that might happen

# Evaluation #
- Regulatory capture - Paid for by firms, incentive to not regulate. Conflict of interest.
- Undermined by standards not being international - lenders may just move abroad to countries 
  with less strict regulations.

# Benefits of Deregulation #
- Credit increases, increasing AD, due to higher investment and consumer spending
- Living standards increase - easier to get a mortgage and more jobs
- Profits for banks - create jobs
- Draws business into the UK - lower regulations will make the UK more internationally
  attractive since banks could make higher profits
