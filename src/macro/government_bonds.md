# Government Bonds #
Government bonds are how the government takes loan. They are also known as gilts.
They sell "bonds" which pay the owner a certain amount every year and when the bond expires, the government pays the fully amount back to the owner.
This makes them very safe investments.

**Coupon** - The guaranteed fixed annual interest payment, normally divided into two 6-month payments.

\\(\text{Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual coupon payment}}{\text{Current market price}} \times 100\\%\\)

If the market price of a bond increases, the yield will decrease (since it has the same coupon, but is more expensive)

A higher yield means it is more desirable.

## Worked Example ##
50 year bond with maturity value $100 and a guaranteed yearly interest payment of £2.50. 5 years after issue the second hand price
falls to £50.
What is the yield before and after?

\\(\text{Yield Before} = \frac{2.50}{100} \times 100\\% = 2.5\\%\\)

\\(\text{Yield After} = \frac{2.50}{50} \times 100\\% = 5\\%\\)
