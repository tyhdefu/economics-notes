- As AD shifts to the right the economy grows and unemployment falls.
- LRAS is **elastic** up until the curve. This is because of spare capacity in the economy.
- As AD reaches the curve, this then leads to a rise in price level - No spare capacity so firms are having to compete for labour.
- The price level rises from this point onwards as the **labour market begins to tighten**

# Tightening of the labour market #
- Small pool of labour remaining with skills, so firms increase ways to attract them to work for them.
- This drives up inflation
