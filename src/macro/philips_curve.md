# Philips Curve #
The Philips curve shows the relationship between unemployment and inflation.

![SR Philips Curve](diagrams/philips_curve_sr.svg#mono-black)

As unemployment reduces from 6% -> 2%, inflation rises from 1% -> 6%  
This is due to demand pull inflation / tightening of the labour (rising wages).

![Philips curve effect of demand side policies](diagrams/philips_curve_demand_policy.svg#mono-black)

- A -> B
  - Government seeks to reduce unemployment via demand policies, such as lowering IR
  - Unemployment reduces from 5% -> 3%
  - But inflation raises to 4% due to demand-pull inflation / tightening of the labour market
- B -> C
  - Firms and Workers realise they are falling for money illusion
  - In real terms they are no better off than not working / firms not making real profits
  - Firms reduce their number of staff, workers return to benefits
  - Unemployment returns to 5%
  - However, now expectations of 4% are built into the economy
    - Firms keep raising prices
    - Workers demand pay raises
  - So 4% inflation stays, at the original rate of unemployment

## Natural Rate of Unemployment ##
- Where unemployment will always return to in the LR.
- LRPC sits at NRU.
- Unemployment below NRU is made up of voluntary unemployment.

To reduce NRU you must decrease voluntary unemployment.
