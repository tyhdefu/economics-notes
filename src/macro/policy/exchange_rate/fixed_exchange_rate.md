# Fixed Exchange Rate #
When the value of a currency is pegged to the value of another currency. E.g Yuan to $  
For example, the Chinese government pegged the Yuan to the dollar.

Example peg, 7 Yuan to $1

If the value of the dollar increases then the Chinese Central Bank will intervene by selling their reserves of the
$ to buy the Yuan. This causes the $ to fall in value and the Yuan to rise in value. They will meet at 7 Yuan = $1

If the value of the dollar falls, then the Chinese Central Bank will intervene by selling their reserves of the Yuan
to buy the $. This causes the Yuan to fall in value and the $ to rise in value. They will meet at 7 Yuan = $1

## Benefits ##
- Trade and Investment
  - Currency stability can promote trade because of less currency risk
- Used as a way of controlling inflation.
  - Causes deflation if pegged to a low level
- Can fix high to reduce the cost of imports
  - Reduces the cost of production and inflation.
- Less need for hedging
  - Hedging is insurance against currency fluctuation. It is a type of insurance
- Countries have to focus in which they can improve their competitiveness without depreciating their ER, these
  tend to be more long run in nature.
  - Have to use supply side policies etc.

## Winners / Losers from China pegging ER low ##

### Winners ###
1. Consumers (in the US)
    - They get cheaper goods and services
2. Tourists (US->China)
3. Large imports
    - E.g. Apple, cheap manufacturing

### Losers ###
1. US firms who export to China
2. US Domestic producers - Cannot compete

## Drawbacks of a Fixed ER ##
- More likely that there is currency speculation / **speculative attack**.
  - This when currency traders buy up a fixed currency hoping that the central bank will run out of reserves
  - Trader in one bank buys up currency
  - Central bank responds by selling reserves of local currency
  - Other banks join the speculative attack
  - They hope that the central bank runs out of local currency reserves
  - They can then sell it off for profit, and causes a massive drop in ER for the country
  - **Small countries** are more vulnerable
- Don't have free control of monetary policy - have to keep in mind peg
