# Floating Exchange Rate #
An exchange rate which is determined solely by the market forces of supply and demand.

## Benefits ##
- Reduced need for currency reserves
  - No target exchange rate so no need for central bank to hold large reserves
- Partial correction for a trade deficit
  - Floating exchange rates can help when the balance of payments is in disequilibrium. In a large C/A deficit
    it applies downward pressure on the exchange rate

## Factors that impact the value ##
- Base Rate
- The demand for imports and exports
  - High exports -> demand shifts right, value increases
  - High imports -> supply shifts right, value decreases
- Inflation -> Increases demand for imports as domestic goods are becoming expensive


## Partial correction of C/A deficit ##
A current account deficit in simple terms means that Imports > Exports.  
This means that there is a large supply of £ since UK companies sell the pound to buy foreign currencies.  
This means that the value of the £ will drop, which in turn makes exports more competitive, helping to balance
out the C/A deficit. This is the partial correction.

### Depends upon ###
Partial correction of C/A deficit will only work when imports and exports are elastic.

This is known as the Marshall-Lerner Condition - The value of net export's elasticity must be greater than 1 in order
to benefit from devaluation of the ER.

#### Elastic Scenario #####
£1 = $1.80 -> £1 = $1.60

**Exports** - Increase in quantity and value since they are more competitive

**Imports** - Decrease in quantity and value since they are more expensive

Therefore, **C/A deficit improves**

#### Inelastic Scenario ####
£1 = $1.80 -> £1 = $1.60

**Exports** - Stays similar, inelastic means no benefit from being more competitive

**Imports** - Get more expensive, but inelastic, so quantity stays similar.

Therefore, **C/A deficit worsens**
