# Crowding Out #
The crowding out view is that a rapid increase in government spending / borrowing may steal scarce productive resources from  the private sector, and end up in the public sector, where there is lower efficiency. This view is a classical view.

- To cover budget, the government borrows money
- To do this it sells bonds to private sector, which raise its revenue.

In order to get institutions to buy bonds, it might mean having to raise the interest rate.
- But raising the interest rate increases saving / reduces investment.
- This means more firms will save and lend their money since interest rates are higher
- But also, the cost of borrowing increases **for firms**, meaning it is harder for them to invest, so investment reduces

AD = C + I + G + (X-M)

Government spending increases, but investment decreases, so no actual growth in AD occurs.
