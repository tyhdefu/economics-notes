# Money Supply / Quantitative Easing #
Quantitative easing involves increasing the money supply.

Originally, to do this, the central bank would just print money, however, this was difficult to control.

Since 2008, there is a new way.

- Central bank creates money
  - Virtually add money to their own account
- Central bank buys [bonds](../government_bonds.md)
  - Buys from banks such as HSBC, Natwest, Santander
  - These banks have a large influx of cash, making banks more liquid
- Banks have lots of cash, so they lend to make profit through interest
  - Lots of banks compete to lend money
  - Lower interest rate
- Causes businesses and consumers to borrow money
  - Consumer spending and Investment increases
  - Aggregate Demand increases
- Unemployment decreases and Economic growth increases

## Drawbacks of Quantitative Easing ##
- Causes demand-pull inflation
- Worsens the C/A balance deficit
  - More credit means more purchasing of luxury imports
- Asset bubbles
  - Spike in property prices
  - Eventually people realise that it cannot rise anymore
  - Bubble pops, everyone tries to sell
  - Price drops rapidly
- Larger gap between rich and poor

# Monetary Policy Committee #
The main objective of the monetary policy committee is inflation 2%.

## Factors under Consideration ##
The monetary policy committee's 9 members are presented with lots of information that influences their decision.

- Financial Markets
  - Share prices - Indicating investor confidence
  - Household wealth
  - Consumer confidence
- The International Economy
  - Including the US, Europe and Asia. Trends in ER of £ against $ and €.
- Money and Credit
  - Bank lending and consumer credit figures analysed
- Demand and output
  - Consumption and planned investment survey figures

- The Labour Market
  - Figures of unemployment - Indicates demand-pull vs cost-push inflation
- Costs and prices

    passing inflation onto consumers
