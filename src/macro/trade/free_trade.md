## Reasons for Free Trade ##
- Lower prices, reduced inflation
- More innovation
- Sunset industry argument poor way to sustain unemployment
  - Costly and unsustainable way to sustain unemployment, use Education and Training instead
- Loss of economic wealth
  - Tariffs create deadweight loss
- Protectionism is regressive
  - Higher prices from tariffs hit those on lower incomes harder
  - Tariffs are usually placed on food and clothes
- Protectionism causes inefficiencies
  - Firms protected from competition don't have an incentive to reduce costs. This leads to even higher costs
- Trade wars
  - Placing tariffs on imports from one country may cause them to place import tariffs on your country, and you may then
    retaliate with more tariffs.
- Protectionism is a "second-best" approach to correctly a country's C/A balance
  - Should use supply side policies instead
  - Can be counted as government failure
