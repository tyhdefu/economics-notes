# World Trade Organisation #
The World Trade Organisation is responsible for trying to promote and regulate free trade agreements between countries.
All almost countries are a member of the WTO.

## Ideal Trade ##
According to the WTO, ideal trade would be:
- Non-discriminatory
    - Countries are not allowed to have informally have free trade with one country but strong protections against another
    - Everything agreed between countries should be formal
- Free from barriers - no protectionism
- Predictable
    - So that countries can foster investment and job creation and businesses can flourish
- Promoting fair competition
    - The WTO will allow for "fair" competition, e.g allow Infant Industries to grow
    - Protectionism only when needed then taken away
- For trade to be beneficial to developing countries
    - Allow special provisions for developing countries

## Roles & Functions of the WTO ##
