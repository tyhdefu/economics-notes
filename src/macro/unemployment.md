Those individuals who are 16 to 66 who are *willing and able* to work, though are not currently in employment.

**Macro Objective** - Achieve "Full employment"  
**Full employment** - Unemployment at 3% or less

\\(\text{Unemployment Rate}  =\frac{\text{People Working}}{\text{People able to work}}\\)

Example:  
1.64 million unemployed
32.5 million in work

UK = \\(\frac{\text{1.64 million}}{\text{32.5 million}}\\) = 4.8%

# Economically Inactive #
- Students
- Disabled
- Pensioners
- Not actively seeking a job
- Under 16
- Retired
- Asylum seekers
- Discouraged Workers

# Measuring unemployment #

## Claimant count ##
The number of people claiming job-seekers allowance each month.
Used to be used but no longer used by the ONS.

It is straight forward to compile  
However, it may be inaccurate because
- People have too much pride to claim / enough wealth already
- It doesn't recognise people who have been raising children and are looking to return to the workforce as unemployed
- Excludes people who aren't eligible to claim JSA (e.g people with no permanent address)
- Doesn't include people who are unemployed but choose not to claim.

## ILO - Labour Force Survey ##
Measures the percentage of the workforce who are without a job but are available for work, and actively seeking employment.

This measure involves a labour force survey.

- Considered to be more accurate than the claimant count method
- It is the international standard and therefore makes comparisons between economies more accurate

Drawbacks:
- The data relies on a sample of the population. It will not be fully representative
- Doesn't represent underemployment, those who have jobs, but are qualified to do more skilled work. They are settling for what they can get.
- Doesn't include the hidden unemployed. These people who have been out of work for a long time, who are seeking work. They are classified as discouraged workers.

# Types of unemployment #

## Frictional Unemployment ##
Individuals that are between jobs, for example transferring from one sector to another. This tends to be a short term situation.

## Structural Unemployment ##
Individuals who have left one sector due to it contracting, but do not have the skills to move into another that is expanding. This is due to occupational immobility.

## Cyclical Unemployment ##
Unemployment that arises due to an economic downturn or onset of a recession.

## Demand-deficient Unemployment ##
Arises due to AD being low within an economy. Easily rectified by boosting AD.

## Seasonal Unemployment ##
Some jobs are linked into certain times of the year, such as the tourist industry during the summer will need less workers in the winter.

# Consequences of Unemployment #

## For individuals ##
- Fall in earnings, even if claiming benefits
- Fall in their standard of living (relative poverty)
- Loss of status
- Stress that can lead to health issues
- The longer they are unemployed, the less employable they become

## For the economy ##
- Unemployment represents an opportunity cost to an economy. Lost output cannot be regained. The economy is operating inefficiently.
- The government will have to increase their spending in order to pay for JSA. They will also receive less money (from taxes). This can lead to a deficit.

## Positives of high unemployment ##
- Firms may be able to lower their wages and find it easier to recruit staff
- Downward pressure on inflation

## Depends on ##
- The rate of unemployment (If unemployment is high, it is harder to get a job)
- How long individuals have been unemployed for
- The type of unemployment

# Voluntary Unemployment #
**Involuntary Unemployment** - Individuals made unemployed due to a recession / demand deficient unemployment  
**Voluntary Unemployment** - Individuals who are unwilling to accept the going wage rate or the type of job available.

**Real wage Unemployment** - The wage rate is above the equilibrium leading to firms reducing the amount of workers they employ.

## Causes ##
- Generous unemployment benefits, making accepting a job less attractive
- High marginal tax rates, which reduce effective pay
- Unemployed hoping to find a job more suited to their skills / qualifications
- Some jobs too tedious, e.g. Fruit picking / Security guard

## Solutions ##
- Reduce unemployment benefits
- Reduce income tax
- Better information / easier to find a matching job
- Retrain to the job they want to do, e.g. Nurse, Teacher (fill skills gaps)

# NAIRU #
**NAIRU** - Non-accelerating rate of inflation

![NAIRU on Keynesian LRAS](diagrams/nairu.svg#mono-black)

NAIRU the level of unemployment above which there will be inflation (labour market tightening).
This is shown on the diagram - Moving AD past NAIRU will cause the price level to increase - i.e. inflation.

## Decreasing NAIRU ##
- Training and Education
  - To fill skills gaps
- Net migration for skilled workers
- Reduce trade union power
  - To stop wages increasing
- Reduce benefits and income tax
