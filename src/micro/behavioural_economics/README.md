# Behavioural Economics #
A method of economic analysis that applies psychological insights into human behaviour
to explain how individuals make choices and decisions.

Normally in economics we assume all agents are acting **rationally**

## Rational Decision Making ##
A decision that an allows an economic agent to maximise their objective, by setting marginal benefit
of an action to its marginal cost.

Factors that rational agents consider
- Value
- Need
- Satisfaction - Marginal Utility
- Price
- Comparison to substitutes

## Cognitive Bias ##
A mistake in reasoning or in some other mental thought occurring as a result of using rules of thumb
or holding onto one's preferences and beliefs, regardless of contrary information.

**Rule of thumb** - A rough and practical method that can be easily applied when making decisions

## Anchoring ##
A cognitive bias describing the human tendency when making decisions to rely too heavily on the first piece
of information offered (the anchor).
Individuals use an initial piece of information when making subsequent judgements.

## Social Norms ##
Forms or patterns of behaviour considered acceptable by a society or a group within that society.
