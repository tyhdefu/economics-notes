# Irrational behaviour #
In economics we often assume that individuals are rational, but this is not always the case. Irrational agents make decisions that don't maximise utility.

Irrationality can lead to market failure, loss of welfare or individual consequences like addiction.

## Types of irrational behaviour ##

A mistake in reasoning or in some other mental thought occurring as a result of using rules of thumb
or holding onto one's preferences and beliefs, regardless of contrary information.

**Rule of thumb** - A rough and practical method that can be easily applied when making decisions

### Herding effect ###
Following other peoples behaviour because you assume it is correct

### Sunk cost fallacy ###
Continuing to invest in something because you have already invested / lost in it.
