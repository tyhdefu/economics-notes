# Measuring Equality #

**Equality** - Measurable - How evenly resources are distributed

**Equity** - Not measurable - Fairness, do people have the same opportunities

## Lorenz Curve ##
The lorenz curve shows the level of inequality on a country

Gini coefficient = \\( \frac{A}{A+B} \\)  
0 -> Perfect equality  
1 -> Perfect inequality  
Lower Gini coefficient -> less equality

### Inequal country - e.g Brazil ###
![Lorenz Curve with high inequality](diagrams/lorenz_curve_inequality.svg#mono-black)

The curve is far from the Lorenz curve, this country has high inequality and a high Gini coefficient

### Equal country - e.g Czech Republic ###
![Lorenz Curve with low inequality](diagrams/lorenz_curve_equality.svg#mono-black)

The curve is close to the Lorenz curve, this country has low inequality and a low Gini coefficient

### Why has the Gini coefficient been increasing in the UK? ###
- Reduction in top-rate tax
- Increase in regressive taxes - VAT
- Real wages have stagnated - Wages have not kept up with inflation
- Benefits / JSA have not kept up with inflation
- Inequality of opportunity exists - High proportion of Oxbridge graduates from privileged backgrounds get the best paid jobs
- Increase in single-parent households
