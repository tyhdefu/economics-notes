# Price Elasticity of Supply #
Price elasticity of supply measures how the **supply** of a product varies with
its **price**.

\\(\text{PES}  =\frac{\\%\Delta QS}{\\%\Delta P}\\)

- Always positive

Elastic supply is better because the company can be responsive to a market in order
to maximise profit.

# Factors that impact PES #
- **Capacity utilisation** - How close to full capacity is a firm/market operating.  
  If there is lots of spare capacity, then supply will be elastic.
- **Availability of stock** - If there is a lot of spare stock then supply will be  
  elastic and vice versa.
- **Availability of raw materials** - If raw materials are in short supply, this is  
  likely to cause supply to be inelastic.
- **Time** - Over time, supply will be more elastic since firms are able to respond  
  to higher prices by investing in more capital

# Perfectly Inelastic Supply #
Perfectly inelastic supply means that a fixed amount will be supplied regardless of the price level.
An example could be the supply of the crown jewels - their price can vary but the quantity supplied won't change, there is always a fixed quantity of 1.
Another example is carbon credits - there are a fixed amount given by the government and then firms have to compete for a fixed supply.

# Perfectly Elastic Supply #
Perfectly elastic supply means that supply will supply an infinite amount of good above/at a certain price level, but nothing below it.
An example of perfectly elastic supply is imports - The world supply of a good has a fixed price, and changes in demand in a particular are insignificant compared to the world supply.
