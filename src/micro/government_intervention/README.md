# Government Intervention #
Sometimes the free market mechanism fails to allocate resources efficiently ([Market Failure](../externalities/market_failure.md)).

In order to solve the market failure, the government can intervene through various ways.

## Government Failure ##
- Government Failure occurs when an intervention leads to a deeper market failure, or worse, a new market failure
- Intervention creates further inefficiencies, a missallocation of resources and a loss of economic / social welfare

1. Policies may have damaging long-term consequences for the economy or society
2. Policies may be ineffective in meeting their stated aims
3. Policies may create more losers than winners

- Can happen if a policy decision fails to create enough of an incentive to change people's behaviour

### Possible Causes ###
- Political Self-interest
- Policy myopia - Quick fixes
- Regulatory Capture
  - Where regulation is designed / influenced by the group it is targetting
- Information failure
- Disincentive effects
- High enforcement / compliance costs
- Conflicting policy objectives
  - Minimum carbon price vs UK competitiveness
- Bureaucracy / Read tape
  - Costs of enforcement may hurt enterprise and incentives
- Unintended consequences
  - Black markets
  - Bank bail outs -> causes moral hazard
  - People circumvent new laws
