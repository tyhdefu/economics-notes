# Demand for Labour #
Demand for labour is **derived**. This is because it is demanded for what it can produce, rather than for the thing itself.

# What determines the demand for Labour #
- Demand / Expected demand for a product / service
- Productivity of a worker
- Wage rate / price of labour
- Complementary labour costs, such as National Insurance and pensions
- Substitutes, such as capital

# MRP - Measuring demand for Labour #
MRP is the change in total revenue from employing one extra worker.

\\(\text{MRP} = \text{Marginal Product} \times \text{Marginal Revenue}\\)  
\\(\text{MRP} = \text{Productivity} \times \text{Price}\\)

# Factors that influence MRP #

|Productivity|Price|
|---|---|
|Training / Skills|Income|
|Incentives|Price Substitutes|
|Motivation|Advertising|
| |Supply (rarity)|

# MRP for a single firm #

|Workers|Output|MP|Price/MR|MRP |TR |
|---    |---   |---|:---:  |--- |---| 
|1      |20    |20 |20     |400 |400|
|2      |80    |60 |20     |1200|1600|
|3      |160   |80 |20     |1600|3200|
|4      |220   |60 |20     |1200|4400|
|5      |260   |40 |20     |800 |5200|
|6      |280   |20 |20     |400 |5600|

# MRP for an industry #

MRP can shift due to two factors:

By MP - Training and development to improve productivity  
By MR - Change in price of product being produced

# WED - wage elasticity of demand #
Wage elasticity measures how response demand for labour is to a change in wage.

\\(WED = \frac{\\%\Delta\text{ in DL}}{\\%\Delta\text{ in W}}\\)

**Inelastic** - Rising wages will not greatly impact on the demand for labour  
**Elastic** - Rising wages will have a large impact on the demand for labour

## Factors that affect WED ##
- Ease of substitution for capital
- Elasticity of the product, since it is a derived demand
- Proportion of labour cost in relation to total cost. If a high proportion of total cost is labour, it is more likely for demand for labour to be elastic.
- Time

## Inelastic WED - Pilot ##
Pilot's WED is inelastic because they are difficult to replace with capital -> People would not fly in a plane without a pilot.
Additionally, they are a necessity for airlines, so they will raise prices rather than shutdown.

## Elastic WED - Cashier ##
Cashier's WED is elastic because they can easily be replaced with capital (self-checkouts).
