# Monopsony #
A Monopsony is a labour market dominated by a **single buyer of labour**.
This prevents a perfect labour market because a single firm has influence over the labour market.

**ACL** - Average cost of Labour = \\(\frac{\text{Total wage costs}}{\text{Number of workers employed}}\\)  
**MCL** - Marginal cost of labour - Addition to cost from employing 1 more worker

# NHS Example #
The NHS is a Monopsony employer for Nurses.
MCL for a Monospony is very high/steep because every time you attract new workers with a higher wage rate, the firm must increase the wages of **all existing workers** to match.

In a competitive labour market the wage would be Wc and the quantity employed Qc.
This would mean no profit as AC=AR.
However, the monopsony uses the fact that it is the main employer to maximise profit (MC=MR) to limit employment to X and although there should be a higher wage, the monopsony pushed wages down to Wm since the workers don't have a choice but to accept the wage (they cannot lose workers, since there are no other firms able to hire them).

# Solution to Monopsony #
A monopsony can be **partially** solved by a trade union.

Collective bargaining allows the trade union to get a higher wage for its workers, moving the wage close to the competitive wage.

## Effectiveness of a trade union against a monopsony ##
- Union density
- WED/WES
- Public support
