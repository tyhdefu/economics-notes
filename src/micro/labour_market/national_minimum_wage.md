# National minimum wage #
A national minimum wage is a wage that almost all workers are paid.

# Positives #
- Living standards improve
- More equal distribution of income
- Increase in labour supply
- Reduced discrimination
- Increased worker productivity (more motivated by higher pay)
- The government has to pay less in benefits

# Negatives #
- May increase unemployment
- UK firms become less competitive (higher costs)
- Smaller businesses are impacted more
- Increased inflation

# Evaluation #
There is evidence that NMW does not cause unemployment, especially if you **increase productivity**.

# Regional National Minimum Wage #
London / SE could have a higher minimum wage due to higher living costs

However:
- People could emmigrate to higher paid areas
- Unfair to be paid differently for the same job
- Increases income equality / legislates divide
- Hard to administrate
