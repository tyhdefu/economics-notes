**Legal monopoly** - 25% market share
**Economic monopoly** - 40% market share

![Monopoly](diagrams/monopolistic_sr.svg#mono-black)

# Characteristics #
- Very high barriers to entry
- Price makers
- SNP in SR and LR
- Profit maximiser
- One firm dominates / very high concentration ratio
- Large Economies of Scale
- Likely to abuse market power

# Examples #
- Tesco - legal monopoly
- Microsoft
- Blu-tac

# Abuse of market power #
A monopoly firm can use its market power to abuse various parties

## Consumers ##
Raise prices above market equilibrium, since consumers have no alternative. 
They can also reduce output to create scarcity and raise the price of their product.

## Rival firms ##
Lower prices below market equilibrium and make losses until the other firm is forced to leave the market

## Suppliers ##
Refuse to buy raw materials unless they drop their prices - since suppliers depend on the firm for profit.

# Natural Monopoly #
In some cases, competition decreases efficiency, for example:
- Railways
- Water provision
- Electricity - National grid

## Characteristics ##
- Extremely high capital cost to set up
- Duplication is unnecessary and wasteful
- Competition does not benefit the consumer

![A Natural monopoly diagram, showing costs start very high and continually decrease](diagrams/natural_monopoly.svg#mono-black)

Costs fall in the LR due to **Economies of Scale**, but do not increase due to Diseconomies of Scale.

The Law of Diminishing returns does not apply to Natural Monopolies because there is so much Capital, that you can keep adding variable factors to it.

# Price Discrimination #
Price discrimination is a way to reduce <a href="../surplus.html">consumer surplus</a>.

You can eliminate consumer surplus with first degree price discrimination, in an auction.
This allows you to extract the highest price from every consumer.

## Types ##

**First degree** - Different price to each individual consumer (perfect price discrimination)  
**Second degree** - Different price to different groups of customers  
**Third degree** - Different price in each country

## Consequences of Price Discrimination ##
- Increased profits redistribute income from consumers to producers
- Output will be larger
- Higher revenue

### Effect on Consumers ###
- Loss of welfare - Consumer surplus disappears in 1st degree price discrimination
- Inequitable - Some consumers have to pay more than others
- If profits reinvested, consumers may get LR benefits, such as increased efficiency -> lower costs and prices
- Lower prices might mean poorer consumers may be able to afford the product

## Examples of second degree price discrimination ##
- Adult vs Child tickets
- Insurance -> age, no claims
- Train -> Peak and off-peak
- Flights -> School holidays / when you book

## Why can train passengers be charged more for peak travel ##
Peak travellers are travelling as a **necessity**, so their demand is **inelastic**, so they can raise prices without losing many customers.
On the other hand, off-peak is usually leisure travel, so it is elastic, and if prices are raised, demand will fall quickly.

## Uber Surge pricing ##
Uber varies it prices a lot depending on:
- Time
- Demand
- Rain / weather
- Amount of available drivers / supply
- Location
