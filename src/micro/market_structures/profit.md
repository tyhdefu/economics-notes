# Profit #

**Accounting Profit** - Total Revenue - Total Costs  
**Super-normal Profit (SNP)** - The amount of profit above normal profit

## Normal Profit ##
Normal profit is the minimum amount of profit required to remain in a marketplace.

If the profit falls below this, then the firm will leave the marketplace and switch to the next best alternative market (provided there are low barriers to exit / low sunk costs).

## The Role of Profit ##
Profit plays an important role in the market economy.

- Profit is the reward to shareholders and owners of a business
- Profit creates incentives for enterprise / innovation
- Profit attracts more firms to an industry, increasing competition
    - This decreases prices in the LR, as firms compete on price
    - This leads to increased choice as there are more products from different firms to chose from
    - Super-normal profit is competed away in the LR
- Profit in the LR allows for Research & Development
    - This leads to dynamic efficiency
    - This leads to lower prices and higher quality products in the LR
    - Increased productivity -> economic growth
- Lack of profit in a industry will cause firms to leave the industry
    - This means profit helps signal where more or less supply is needed in an industry, helping to achieve allocative efficiency
- Higher profit enables wages to rise
- Profit can be taxed via corporate tax to allow the government to gain revenue
- Profit can allow firms to build up a buffer against an economic downturn

## Profit Evaluation ##
- Profit can drive firms to cut corners, for example:
    - Dumping waste / excess pollution
    - Underpaying workers
- Profit can cause firms to take too many risks, i.e 2008
- Profit can lead to inequality especially if firms have monopoly/monopsony power
    - It can allow market abuse, such as undercutting competitors to drive out competition
- Firms may have other objectives
