# Public Goods #

## Main Characteristics ##

### Non-excludability ###
Benefits derived from pure public goods cannot be confined to those who have paid for it. Non-payers can enjoy the benefits of consumption at no financial cost to themselves - The free-rider problem.

### Non-rival consumption ###
Each party's enjoyment of the good does not diminish others' enjoyment

### Non-rejectable ###
The collective supply of a pure public good for all means that it cannot be rejectable by people.
An example is a national nuclear defence system or major flood defence projects.
