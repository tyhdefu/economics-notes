Supply side policies shift LRAS to the right. They are subset of fiscal policies.

# Policies #

## Education and training ##

- Improves Labour - more skilled workforce
- Improves Enterprise - more education means more ideas
- Unemployment decreases
- Economic growth
- Occupational mobility

### Drawbacks ###
- Takes a very long time to cause a shift in LRAS
- Very costly
- Can widen the gap between the rich and the poor. Those who are not educated are disadvantaged in the job market, and if they get a job, they are likely to be paid less.

## Privatisation ##
- Improves Capital - More investment
- Improves Enterprise - Innovation
- Economic Growth
- Decreases inflation

### Drawbacks ###
- If it is a natural monopoly, such as tap water, it will not be very competitive and the costs are mostly fixed (e.g pipes). A monopoly would likely end up having cheaper prices.
- The goal of some industries shouldn't be profit - For example healthcare, the objective is to make people better, not earn as much money as possible.
- Regulation may be needed to control the monopoly power if it was not owned by the government - it may be easier / cheaper to just keep a government-owned monopoly.
- Fragmentation - For example trains, train tickets would have to be negotiated with each train company you travelled with.

## Reduce unemployment benefits and income tax ##
- Labour - encouraged to work
- Unemployment decreases
- Economic growth
- Current Account worsens
- Inflation increases

### Drawbacks ###
- Gap between poor and rich becomes larger
- Those unemployed and unable to get a job because of their skills will not be incentivised to get a job and will only be hurt by the policy.

## Deregulation ##
- Land - natural resources allowed to be exploited
- Unemployment decreases
- Inflation decreases

### Drawbacks ###
- Regulations could be in place for the safety of workers. Removing these regulations could cause increased injury and hence increased cost for the healthcare system.
- Regulations could be put in place to force the firm to pay for its negative externalities. Removing this regulation would cause the cost to be paid by the government elsewhere.

## Infrastructure Investment ##
- Improves Land
- Improves Labour - occupational mobility
- Inflation decreases
- Economic Growth increases
- Current Account improves

### Drawbacks ###
- Usually very expensive
- Normally takes a long time to be completed and hence shift LRAS to the right

## Immigration ##
- Improves Labour - more workers
- Inflation decreases

### Drawbacks ###
- May take away jobs from native workers, who then need to be paid unemployment benefits.
- May cause wages to decrease as there is more competition and firms have a greater choice.
- May reduce incentives to develop technologies to improve the productivity of each worker, since it is cheaper to hire more labour. This could lead to a lower living standard than if net migration was not increased.

## Restriction of trade union activity ##
- Improves Labour
- Inflation decreases

### Drawbacks ###
- Less safe working conditions - Trade unions lobby for safe working conditions and restricting them could reduce this.
- Cannot overcome unfair wages - cannot bargain for higher wages
- Less job security, and hence lower consumer confidence. If workers are in a trade union, they will feel more secure and hence be likely to save less and spend more
